# Angular Tour of Heroes

We've finally reached the point where we follow the Angular tutorial. If you have been following along to this point, it may seem for such a simple tutorial there are too many chapters before this point. However, might I counter that a proper understanding of setting up your environment and understanding the TypeScript syntax will allow you to read the tutorial code blocks with a greater appreciation for it's meaning. Programming is not just a matter of read, copy, and retype. In my personal opinion, programming is an exploratory endeavor both to find the limits of technology and to grasp the meaning of other developer's code. But before we begin our proper tour of Angular, there is yet a few more important considerations we must delve into - what is Angular and Angular Architecture.
