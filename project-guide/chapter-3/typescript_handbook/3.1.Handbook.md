# TypeScript Handbook

The TypeScript Handbook is a comprehensive guide to the TypeScript language. It is meant to be read online at [the TypeScript website](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html) or [directly from this repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Handbook/blob/master/pages/Basic%20Types.md).

In this book, I will only list some of the basic content areas most applicable to this project.
