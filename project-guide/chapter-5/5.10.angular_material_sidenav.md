#### Refactoring with Angular Material Sidenav

Before we begin the next part of the Angular Tour of Heroes tutorial, we will need to have some navigation around our application. In most simple cases, you could use the `mat-navbar` component to have a list of navigation links. However, to learn more about the basics of Angular Material, we will begin adding a sidenav with our application. In most web and mobile applications, the sidenav can be opened with the hamburger menu item we defined earlier in our `mat-sidenav`.
