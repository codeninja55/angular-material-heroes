# Windows - Development Environment

This is a setup guide for getting Angular and Angular Material working on your local environment. Please note, the settings presented will only be suitable for a local environment. The guide will be split into different sections that include:

2. [Angular CLI and Angular project](#Angular CLI and Angular project)

##NodeJS and Node Package Manager (npm)

[Download NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

The first thing you will need is a version of NodeJS. This project will be developed with the latest Long-Term Support release 8.9.1. This package also comes with Node Package Manager (npm) version 5.5.1. 

| REFERENCES                               |
| ---------------------------------------- |
| More information about NodeJS can be found within their [guides](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/). |
| More information about npm can be found within their [documentations](https://docs.npmjs.com/). |



#### Steps:

1. Go to the folder where you downloaded the `node-v8.9.1-x64.msi`.
2. Install by following the installation guide. 
3. npm will be installed along with each NodeJS version.
4. Once installed, check you have the Node.js Command Prompt by opening your `start` bar or clicking your Windows button and searching for it.

5. Check npm and node have been installed correctly by typing:

```bash
> node -v 
v8.9.1
> npm -v
5.5.1
```

##### Local vs Global Packages

There are two ways to install NodeJS packages: locally or globally. You choose which kind of installation to use based on how you want to use the package.

If you want to use it as a command line tool, something like the grunt CLI, then you want to install it globally. On the other hand, if you want to depend on the package from your own module using something like Node's `require`, then you want to install locally.

To download packages globally, you simply use the command `npm install -g <package>`.

## Angular CLI and Angular project

####  Step 1. Set up the Development Environment

Install **Node.js and npm** if they are not already on your machine.

> NOTE:
>
> **Verify that you are running at least node 6.9.x and npm 3.x.x** by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window. Older versions produce errors, but newer versions are fine.

Install the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) globally.

```bash
> npm install -g @angular/cli
```
#### Step 2. Create a new project

Generate a new project and skeleton application by running the following commands:

```bash
> ng new my-app 
```

#### Step 3: Serve the application

Go to the project directory and launch the server.

```bash
> cd angular-material-heroes
> ng serve --open
```
_NOTES:_

* The `ng serve` command launches the server, watches your files, and rebuilds the app as you make changes to those files.

* Using the `--open` (or just `-o`) option will automatically open your browser on `http://localhost:4200/`.

  â€‹

Your app greets you with a message:

![Angular 2 app](https://angular.io/generated/images/guide/cli-quickstart/app-works.png)



#### Step 4: Edit your first Angular component

The CLI created the first Angular component for you. This is the *root component* and it is named `app-root`. You can find it in `./src/app/app.component.ts`.

Open the component file and change the `title` property from *Welcome to app!!* to *Welcome to My First Angular App!!*:

###### src/app/app.component.ts

```typescript
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'My First Angular App';
}
```

The browser reloads automatically with the revised title. That's nice, but it could look better.

Open `src/app/app.component.css` and give the component some style.

###### src/app/app.component.css

```css
h1 {
  color: #369;
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
  font-size: 250%;
}
```

## Project file review

The first file you should check out is `README.md`. It has some basic information on how to use CLI commands. Whenever you want to know more about how Angular CLI works make sure to visit [the Angular CLI repository](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) and [Wiki](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki).



#### The `src` folder

Your app lives in the `src` folder. All Angular components, templates, styles, images, and anything else your app needs go here. Any files outside of this folder are meant to support building your app.
