# Angular Material Heroes

A book following the Tour of Heroes guide from [angular.io](https://angular.io/tutorial) and incorporating [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) project. This project and it's accompanying guide is a work in progress and more will be added as I go.

The guide to this project can be found at [GitBook Project Guide](https://codeninja55.gitbooks.io/angular-material-heroes/content/).



## What is the goal of this project and guide?

First and foremost, the motivation and goal of this project was for me to learn Angular 2. I am also a huge fan of Google's [Material Design](https://material.io/) philosophy and as a result, wanted to understand how to use Angular Material in my project. I am writing the guide for this project both as a reference for myself and for those who are also on this learning path and stumble upon this. While I am not an experienced web developer, I have developed software in other domains using Python and Linux. It is my hope that this guide can help any new developer along. 



## Who this project is made for?

This project is made for those raw beginners out in Angular and Web Development (like myself). This book will go through all the steps necessary to set up a development environment and follow the Angular guide. Furthermore, this project will include references to extra materials for in-depth research. 



## How to follow progress?

Each chapter of the project guide can be followed by its accompanying branch. Each branch will be named chapter_#. 



## Code convention

Code convention will follow the Markdown syntax. Commands and output that are written for BASH or Command Prompt will include a $ (convention for Linux BASH). Where necessary, the commands for Windows will be included also. I do apologise if some of the content is incorrect, in particular for MacOS, as I do not own an Apple device to test any configurations and changes. However, most MacOS commands and development environment will be similar to Linux.



## What am I using?

While not necessary for you to follow along, these are some of the tools I will be using throughout this project. Some of these tools come free via the Open-Source movement or have student editions. If you are a student, I highly encourage you take advantage of these and support the developers where you can.
